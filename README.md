# GSUI — GSUI + GearTree-style GearSwap integration

## 🔑 Hotkey

**Default toggle: `B`**

Press `B` in-game to show or hide the window. Disabled while the chat bar or macro editor is open.

**Rebind it any time** — GSUI is the only addon in the family with live hotkey rebinding:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `//gsui changekey p` | Bind to a specific letter / digit (a-z, 0-9, F1-F12) |
| `//gsui changekey capture` | Press any physical key — it becomes the new toggle |
| `//gsui changekey #45` | Bind to a raw DirectInput scancode (any 0-255) |
| `//gsui changekey off` | Disable the hotkey entirely; `//gsui` still works |
| `//gsui changekey` | Echo the current binding |

The rebind takes effect immediately — no `//lua reload` needed.

Slash-command equivalents: `//gsui`, `//gsui toggle`.

---

**Status: in development.** This is a fork of [GSUI](https://github.com/mullerdane85-hash/GSUI)
that adds direct read/edit/save integration with your currently-loaded
GearSwap Lua file, similar to [GearTree](https://github.com/tru2/GearTree).

GSUI runs **side-by-side with GSUI** so the stable addon stays working
while we iterate on the new features here.

## Key differences from GSUI

| | GSUI | GSUI |
|---|---|---|
| Toggle key | `B` | `N` |
| Slash command | `//gsui` | `//gsui` (or `//g2`) |
| Data file | `GSUI/data/...` | `GSUI/data/...` (separate settings) |
| Window title | "GSUI" | "GSUI" |

Both addons can be loaded at the same time — they don't share state or
keybinds.

## Planned features (the "incorporate GearTree" work)

- [ ] Auto-detect the currently-loaded GearSwap file based on the
      player's job (e.g. `Kalitzo_whm.lua` for WHM).
- [ ] Parse the file as text (not execute) to extract the `sets` table
      hierarchy — idle, engaged, precast, midcast, etc.
- [ ] New "Sets" tab showing the gear sets as a clickable tree.
      Click to expand / preview; double-click to equip via `gs equip`.
- [ ] Right-click a set to see its full slot-by-slot contents + augments
      detected via `extdata.decode`.
- [ ] Edit a set's slot in-place inside GSUI's UI, then save back to
      the source `.lua` file with an automatic backup.
- [ ] Annotation/note system for sets without modifying the source.
- [ ] Undo last save via `//gsui undo` (restore latest backup).

Heavy inspiration / reference implementation: [tru2/GearTree](https://github.com/tru2/GearTree)
(public domain / Unlicense — code may be ported or bundled freely).

## Inherits everything from GSUI 1.3.0

All the existing tabs and features are preserved:
- GearSwap set builder (`F1`)
- Inventory organizer with multi-select + bulk-move (`F2`)
- KB/Drag mode toggle (`F3`)
- Filter dropdown (`F4`)
- Gear Stats / Total Stats toggle
- Icon extraction from FFXI DAT files
- Save/load named sets (`/gsui save <name>` / `/gsui load <name>`)

See the [GSUI 1.3.0 changelog](https://github.com/mullerdane85-hash/GSUI/blob/main/README.md)
for the full list of inherited features.

## Credits

Inherits all of GSUI's credits (Rubenator, Trv, Byrthnoth — see GSUI's
README for details), plus:

- **tru2** — author of GearTree. The parser / tree / writer design that
  the planned Sets-tab work draws from is GearTree's. Bundled or ported
  code will live under `libs/gear_tree/` once added.

## Development notes

This addon is unstable while the GearTree integration is being built.
For day-to-day use, run **GSUI** (the stable one). Load GSUI only when
testing the new features:

```
//lua load GSUI
```
