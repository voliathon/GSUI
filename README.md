# GSUI - GearSwap UI & Inventory Organizer

A Windower 4 addon for FFXI that provides a visual gear set builder, inventory organizer, and live gear stat tracker.

## Updates

### v1.3.0
- **New**: Clickable Gear Stats header — toggles between **Gear Stats** view (gear-only contributions, the original behavior) and **Total Stats** view (computed totals using base STR/DEX/etc. + skill tiers + gear)
- **⚠ Work in progress**: The Total Stats view (Char Total Stats — computed Accuracy/Attack/Magic Accuracy/etc.) is **not producing correct numbers yet**. The toggle works and the panel renders, but the calculated totals are off. Fixes coming in a future update. Use the regular Gear Stats view for accurate gear-side numbers in the meantime.
- **New**: A `-- Total Accuracy --` block is also injected at the top of the regular Gear Stats panel as a quick reference (same WIP caveat — display is there, accuracy of the number isn't fully trusted yet)
- **New**: Player stats (STR/DEX/VIT/AGI/INT/MND/CHR/HP/MP) are now cached from incoming Char Stats packet `0x061` (server pushes this on login, zone, gear change, and buff change). Until the first packet arrives the panel says "stats not yet received — swap any gear once or zone to get them"
- **New**: Persistent **inventory cache** (`libs/inventory_cache.lua`) — speeds up first-open scan by remembering item icons/data across sessions. Saved per-character to `data/inv_cache_<name>.lua` (gitignored)
- **Bug Fix**: Stat exclude logic — extracting "Accuracy +N" from a line like `Accuracy+44 Magic Accuracy+44` was rejecting the whole line because it contained the excluded word "Mag". Now strips just the excluded stat phrase so the simple Accuracy total is correct
- **New**: Multi-select + bulk-move in Organizer mode — right-click inventory items to toggle them in/out of a selection (yellow tint shows what's selected, count is shown in the status line). Works in both Drag mode and KB mode. Then right-click a bag in the left panel to move the entire selection there. `/gsui deselect` clears the selection.
- **Bug Fix**: Multi-select highlight now renders correctly in either drag or keyboard mode
- **Bug Fix**: Mog-house detection works when GSUI loads while you're already inside a mog house (previously it only ran the detection on zone-in)

### v1.2.1
- **New**: F1/F2/F3/F4 keybinds — F1 GearSwap, F2 Organizer, F3 toggle KB/Drag mode, F4 open filter dropdown
- **New**: Filter dropdown navigable in KB mode — F4 opens it, arrow keys browse, Enter selects, Escape closes
- **New**: Keybind hints shown on tabs: `GearSwap [F1]`, `Organizer [F2]`, `[F3:KB]`, `[F4] Filter`
- **Bug Fix**: White-box icons no longer appear on first open (extraction cache now warms eagerly)
- **Bug Fix**: Status messages auto-clear after a timeout instead of lingering until the next action

### v1.2.0
- **Bug Fix**: Icons that required scrolling to see now load correctly (fixed extraction cache issue)
- **Bug Fix**: Gear Stats panel now updates live when building custom sets and correctly calculates all stats (Magic Evasion, Damage Taken, etc.)
- **New**: Right-click an equipment slot to remove a single piece (or Delete key in KB mode)
- **New**: Slot indicator shown in item tooltips — always shows which slot(s) an item can go in
- **New**: Slot protection — prevents equipping items in incompatible slots
- **New**: Filter by slot — click an empty equip slot to filter inventory to items for that slot. Works alongside stat filters.
- **New**: Active filter keywords are highlighted with >> in item tooltips
- **New**: Improved filter matching — "Enhancing Magic" filter now catches items like Incanter's Torque
- **New**: Save/Load gear sets — save named sets, load them back, manage via commands (`/gsui save`, `/gsui load`, `/gsui sets`, `/gsui delete`)

## Layout

The UI has four columns:

1. **Left Panel** - Equipment slots (GearSwap mode) or Bag list (Organizer mode)
2. **Inventory Grid** - Browsable item grid with scroll and filter
3. **Item Tooltip** - Hover over any item to see its full description, augments, jobs, and level
4. **Gear Stats** - Live summary of stats from your currently equipped gear

All panels support mouse wheel scrolling when content overflows.

## Gear Stats Panel

The header reads **`Gear Stats  [click to toggle]`** — click it to switch between two views:

### Gear Stats view (default)

Sums of stats from your equipped gear, grouped by category:

- **Casting** - Fast Cast, Quick Magic, Conserve MP, Spell Interrupt Down
- **Haste** - Gear Haste (shows cap at 26%)
- **Pet/SMN** - BP Delay, BP Damage, Pet Haste/Attack/MAB/Accuracy, Avatar Perpetuation, Summoning Skill
- **Melee** - Double Attack, Triple Attack, Store TP, Dual Wield, Subtle Blow, Crit Rate
- **WS** - Weapon Skill Damage
- **Magic** - Magic Atk Bonus, Magic Accuracy, Magic Burst Damage
- **Defense** - DT, PDT, MDT, Magic Evasion, Magic Def Bonus
- **Healing** - Cure Potency
- **Utility** - Refresh, Regen, Treasure Hunter
- **Stats** - HP, MP, STR, DEX, VIT, AGI, INT, MND, CHR, Accuracy, Attack

A `-- Total Accuracy --` block is shown just above the Stats section as a quick reference. Stats with known caps (Fast Cast 80%, Haste 26%, DT 50%, etc.) show the cap and display `[CAPPED]` when reached. Stats update live whenever your equipment changes.

### Total Stats view (⚠ work in progress)

> The computed numbers in this view are **not accurate yet** — the formulas and skill-tier resolution still need work. The panel is wired up and toggles correctly, but treat the totals shown as approximate until a future update. The regular Gear Stats view above is fully accurate for gear-side numbers.

Computed totals combining base stats, skill, and gear:

- **ACC + GACC = Total Accuracy** — `floor(DEX × 0.75) + skill_tier(weapon_skill) + gear_acc`
- **ATK + GATK = Total Attack** — `8 + skill_tier + STR + gear_atk`
- **MACC + GMACC = Total Magic Accuracy** — `skill_tier(highest_magic_skill) + gear_macc`
- **GMAB** — Gear Magic Atk Bonus (no client-side computed total available)
- **Base + Gear** — STR/DEX/VIT/AGI/INT/MND/CHR including everything FFXI credits (base, merits, JPs, gear, buffs)
- **HP / MP** — current and max

The skill tier formula matches BG-wiki:
- skill ≤ 200 → 1:1
- 200–400 → diminishing 0.9× after 200
- 400–600 → diminishing 0.8× after 400
- 600+ → 0.9× after 600

Player base stats come from incoming packet `0x061` which the server pushes on login, zone, every gear change, and every buff change — so the values stay current.

## GearSwap Mode

Build GearSwap sets visually. Your current equipment and all equippable items for your job are displayed with icons.

- **Drag** items from the inventory grid onto equipment slots to build a set
- **Keyboard mode** - Arrow keys to navigate items, Enter to select, Tab to switch to equip slots, Enter to assign, Escape to cancel
- **Filter** items by stat/ability using the dropdown (auto-detects relevant filters)
- **Generate Set** copies a GearSwap-formatted Lua table to your clipboard
- **Remove All** clears all slots for a blank set
- **Re-equip** resets slots to your currently equipped gear

## Organizer Mode

Click the **Organizer** tab to switch. Browse and manage items across all bags.

- **Bag list** on the left shows all bags with item counts. Click a bag to view its contents.
- **Sorting toggle** (top-right of grid) switches between **Gear First** and **Items First**
  - Gear First: equipment sorted by slot, weapon type, item level, equip level; then items alphabetically
  - Items First: items alphabetically, then equipment after
- **Drag items** from the grid onto a bag in the left panel to move them (or use keyboard mode: Enter to select, Tab to bags, Enter to assign)
- **Conflicts** button finds duplicate rings/earrings in the same bag (GearSwap can't distinguish identical items in L/R slots)
- **Scattered** button finds non-equipment items split across multiple bags
  - Dragging a scattered item onto a bag consolidates ALL copies from every bag into that destination

## Keyboard Navigation Mode

Toggle with `/gsui kb` or click `[Drag]`/`[KB]` on the title bar. The setting persists across sessions.

In keyboard mode, all game mouse input is blocked so you won't accidentally move the camera or target while navigating.

- **Arrow keys** - Navigate inventory grid, equip slots, or bag list
- **Enter** - Select an item from inventory (focus auto-switches to equip/bag panel), then Enter again on a target to assign
- **Tab** - Manually switch focus between inventory and equip slots (GearSwap) or bag list (Organizer)
- **Escape** - Cancel current selection

A gold highlight shows your cursor position. A green highlight marks the selected item in inventory.

## Mog House

Mog house bags (Safe, Safe 2, Storage, Locker) are greyed out when outside the mog house and become available when you enter. Portable bags (Wardrobes, Satchel, Sack, Case) are always accessible.

## Troubleshooting

### Inventory grid is blank (no item icons), but tooltips show item text when hovering

This is the most common report and almost always means **GSUI can't read the FFXI DAT files** to extract item icons. The inventory scanner still works (which is why hover tooltips and the Gear Stats panel show real data), but the icon extractor can't open the game's icon archives.

**Diagnose it:**
```
//gsui debug
```
This dumps the cache path, the FFXI path GSUI is using, whether a known-good DAT file is readable, and whether a test extraction succeeds. Paste the output if you ask for help.

**Fix it:**
- On addon load you should also see a warning in chat like `[GSUI] WARNING: cannot read FFXI DAT files (...)`. The chat message also prints the path it's trying.
- Set the correct FFXI install directory:
  ```
  //gsui gamepath C:\Path\To\PlayOnline\SquareEnix\FINAL FANTASY XI
  ```
  (Use *your* actual FFXI directory — the one that contains the `ROM` folder.)
- After setting the path, type `//gsui refresh` to rescan, or close and reopen the window.

**Why this happens:**
- Windower's auto-detected `windower.ffxi_path` is wrong (uncommon, but happens on Steam installs or non-default drives).
- The FFXI directory was moved after Windower was set up.
- File-system permissions block `cache/` writes (rare on Windows, more common with portable installs).

## Credits

GSUI stands on the shoulders of two long-running Windower addons and the people who built them. Portions of this addon are directly derived from or modeled after their work:

### [Rubenator](https://github.com/Rubenator) (Leviathan) — EquipViewer
- **`libs/icon_extractor.lua`** is **directly Rubenator's code** from EquipViewer, used here under their BSD-style license. The copyright header is preserved at the top of that file. This is the module that reads item icons out of the FFXI client's DAT files so they can be drawn in the GSUI window.
- The visual approach of rendering each equipment slot with its own item-icon image primitive was inspired by EquipViewer's UI.
- Original EquipViewer: https://github.com/Rubenator/EquipViewer

### Trv (Windower Discord)
- The **base DAT-extraction code** that powers `icon_extractor.lua` was, per Rubenator's own credit line, "graciously provided by Trv of Windower discord." That code path is what makes it possible to pull icons out of the game files at runtime, and by extension is what lets GSUI show item images at all.

### [Byrthnoth](https://github.com/Byrth) — GearSwap
- The **gear-set Lua table format** that GSUI generates via `/gsui gen` and the `save`/`load` commands is GearSwap's native syntax — the same `sets.xxx = { main = ..., head = ..., ... }` shape that every GearSwap user already writes.
- The **slot vocabulary** used in `libs/set_generator.lua` (`main`, `sub`, `range`, `ammo`, `head`, `neck`, `left_ear`, `right_ear`, `body`, `hands`, `left_ring`, `right_ring`, `back`, `waist`, `legs`, `feet`) is GearSwap's slot list verbatim, so anything GSUI produces drops cleanly into a GearSwap job file.
- The broader concept of "gear sets as named, swappable data structures" that GSUI helps you build visually is entirely GearSwap's framing.
- Original GearSwap: https://github.com/Windower/Lua/tree/dev/addons/GearSwap

### Inspiration only (no code)
- The Windower 4 core team and the `libs/` shipped with Windower (`packets`, `resources`, `images`, `texts`, `config`, etc.) — GSUI uses these as a dependency, it doesn't fork them.

If you find any GSUI code that originated elsewhere and isn't credited here, please open an issue — the omission is unintentional.
